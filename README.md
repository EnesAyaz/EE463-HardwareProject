# EE463-HardwareProject
The repository includes simulations, reports, researchs and designs of DC Motor Drive 


To do 
* Single Phase Thyristor Rectifier with resistive load, indcutive load and Motor simulation will be done.
* Buck Boost Converter simulation will be done.
* LC filter or C filter will be designed and simulated. 
* Gate Driver and Controller will be chosen.
